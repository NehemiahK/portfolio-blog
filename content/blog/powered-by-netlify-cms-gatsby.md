description: A quick blog post created with Netlify CMS and Gatsby
---
I wanted to created a quick demo.

I am using NetlifyCMS which gives me a nice interface for creating blog posts and will automatically save them in my filesystem and rebuild the site.

```
function hello(){
    console.log('hello, world')
}
```
